# Conditions database

A demo of a conservations conditions database to use across ArchivesSpace and Alma. API calls are real but data is not. The 'submit' button currently doesn't change any data in ArchivesSpace or Alma and is just a proof of concept at the moment.

## Usage & Requirements

Create a virtual environment

`pip install requests`

`pip install streamlit`

`pip install archivessnake`

The Streamlit app can then be tested locally by running

`streamlit run Add_new_condition` in the venv terminal.
